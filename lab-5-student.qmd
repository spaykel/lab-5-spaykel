For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related datasets to solve a murder mystery!

## Instructions

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins, driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png)

Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

+ Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
+ Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the tables manually.
+ Use good code formatting practices.
+ Comment your code.
+ Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.

### Tips 

You may find the `pull()` function handy for displaying each clue as you go along.

## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in all of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or remove this!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: read-in-data

library(tidyverse)

# If purrr is not detected, install the package
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")

```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on January 15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the person responsible for the murder?!

```{r}
#| label: inspecting-crime-scene-report

head(crime_scene_report)

crime_report <- crime_scene_report |>
  filter(type == "murder", date == 20180115)

crime_report |> pull(description)

print(crime_report[3, 3])
```
*Crime Report: Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".*

**Follow the evidence to the person responsible for the murder, building a report as you go.**
Hint: Make sure you check for interviews with any suspects!

```{r}
#| label: find_witness

first_witness <- person |>
  filter(address_street_name == "Northwestern Dr") |>
  arrange(desc(address_number)) |>
  slice(1)

first_witness |> pull(name)

second_witness <- person |>
  filter(address_street_name == "Franklin Ave", str_detect(name, "Annabel"))

second_witness |> pull(name)
```

Our first two witnesses are Morty Schapiro, who lives at the last house on Northwestern Dr, and Annabel Miller, who lives on Franklin Ave

```{r}
#| label: investigate_witnesses

morty_interview <- interview |>
  filter(person_id == first_witness$id) |>
  pull(transcript)

morty_interview

annabel_interview <- interview |>
  filter(person_id == second_witness$id) |>
  pull(transcript)

annabel_interview
```

Interviews from the suspects: <br>
*"I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a \"Get Fit Now Gym\" bag. The membership number on the bag started with \"48Z\". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included \"H42W\"."* <br>
*"I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th."*

```{r}
#| label: follow_leads

gold_members <- get_fit_now_member |>
  filter(membership_status == "gold", str_starts(id, "48Z"))

gym_visits <- get_fit_now_check_in |>
  filter(check_in_date == 20180109 & membership_id %in% gold_members$id) |>
  inner_join(gold_members, by = c("membership_id" = "id"))

suspects_with_cars <- gym_visits |>
  inner_join(person, by = c("person_id" = "id")) |>
  inner_join(drivers_license, by = c("license_id" = "id")) |>
  filter(str_detect(plate_number, "H42W"))

suspects_with_cars |>
  select(name.y, plate_number, car_make, car_model, age, gender)
```

Following this lead already gets us to the killer: Jeremy Bowers

```{r}
#| label: interview_jeremy_bowers

bowers_interview <- interview |>
  filter(person_id == (person |> filter(name == "Jeremy Bowers") |> pull(id)))

bowers_interview |> pull(transcript)

```
Interviewing Jeremy Bowers reveals that the buck doesn't stop with him: *"I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5\" (65\") or 5'7\" (67\"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017."* <br><br>
There's a mastermind behind this operation; let's try to find them.

```{r}
#| label: find_mastermind
 mastermind <- drivers_license |>
  filter(gender == "female", 
         car_make == "Tesla",
         car_model == "Model S",
         hair_color == "red",
         (height %in% c("65", "67"))) 

mastermind_name <- mastermind |> 
  inner_join(person, by = c("id" = "license_id")) |>
  select(name)

mastermind_name
```


## And the final suspect is...

### Red Korb, who hired Jeremy Bowers to do her dirty work.
